## Project

D-reanimated is a learning project focused on exploring the capabilities of animations in React Native using Expo and Reanimated. The main goal is to create a variety of animations that are reusable across different projects. Each animation serves as a standalone example that could inspire or be directly implemented in other applications. This project aims to grow into a rich library of components that demonstrate smooth, complex, and engaging animations, all while offering insights into best practices for animation development in mobile apps.
